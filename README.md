# caching_unstructuredp2p

Implementation of caching mechanism in an overlay unstructured peer to peer network which allows sharing files as well as cache pointers to resources. Caching mechanism helps in reducing routing efforts wherein queries are generated randomly. This code implements caching at the nodes of the network, thereby implementing efficient solution to search contents in a distributed system.
